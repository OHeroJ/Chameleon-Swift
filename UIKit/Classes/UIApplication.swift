            // happy to function without ever having any UIResponder having had a becomeFirstResponder sent to it. This method seems to work by starting
            // with sender and traveling down the responder chain from there if target==nil. The first object that responds to the given action is sent
            // the message. (or no one is)

            // if none was ever set? Apparently the answer is, if none were set, the message doesn't get delivered. If you expicitly set a UIResponder
            // using becomeFirstResponder, then it will receive keyboard/motion events but it does not receive any other messages from other views that
            // happen to end up calling this method with a nil target. So that's a seperate mechanism and I think it's confused a bit in the docs.

// although that's not really tested so it probably wouldn't work very well. It sets NSApplication's delegate to a very simple dummy object
// which traps -applicationShouldTerminate: to handle background tasks so you don't have to bother with it. Like NSApplicationMain, this
// looks for a NIB file in the Info.plist identified by the NSMainNibFile key and will load it using AppKit's NIB loading stuff. In an
// attempt to make this as confusing as possible, when the main NIB is loaded, it uses the UIApplication (NOT THE NSApplication!) as the
// file's owner! Yep. Insane, I know. I generally do not use NIBs myself, but it's nice for the menu bar. So... yeah...
